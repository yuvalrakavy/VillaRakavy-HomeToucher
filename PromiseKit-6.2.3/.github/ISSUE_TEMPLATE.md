If your issue is a Swift compile issue then read our [Troubleshooting guide] first!

Please specify the following information:

* PromiseKit version: **major version is enough unless you have a build issue**
* If you used CocoaPods or Carthage or some other method to install

> Please format your code in triple backticks!

> Please indent your code so it is readable!
